# There are five types of functions on the basis of arguments:
# 1. Function with no arguments
# 2. Function with fixed arguments
# 3. Function with named arguments (keyword arguments)
# 4. Function with default arguments
# 5. Function with variable-length arguments

# Example 2 of function with fixed arguments
 # This is called positional arguments. Position of arguments is important. 
opt(2, 4)# 6, -2. Here, 2 is assigned to x and 4 is assigned to y.
opt(4, 2)  # 6, 2. Here, 4 is assigned to x and 2 is assigned to y.

print("~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~")

# Example 3 of function with named arguments (keyword arguments)
# This is called keyword arguments. Position of arguments is not important. 
opt(x=2, y=4)  # 6, -2. Here, 2 is assigned to x and 4 is assigned to y.
opt(y=4, x=2)  # 6, -2. Here, 2 is assigned to x and 4 is assigned to y.
