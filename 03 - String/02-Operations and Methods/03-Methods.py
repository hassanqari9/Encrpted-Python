'''
The center method in Python is used to center-align a string within a specified width by padding it with spaces (or any other specified character) on both sides. In your code snippet, str1.center(50) centers the string str1 within a width of 50 characters.

The len function in Python returns the length of a string, which is the number of characters it contains.

So, print(len(str1.center(50))) will print the length of the string after it has been centered within a 50-character wide field. It's important to note that the length will be exactly 50 characters, as center ensures that the original string is exactly in the middle of this 50-character field, padding with spaces on both sides as necessary.

If the original string is longer than the specified width in center, no padding is added, and the length of the resulting string will be the same as the length of the original string. In your case, since the width specified is 50, and assuming str1 is shorter than 50 characters, the length printed will be 50.
