# List - A list is a data structure for storing a sequence of values. The values stored in a list are called items or elements. Lists are similar to strings, which are ordered collections of characters, except that the elements of a list can be of any type. Lists and strings — and other things that behave like ordered collections — are called iterables.

# 1. Mutable Data Type - Lists in Python are mutable, meaning the elements can be changed after creation.
# 2. Ordered Collection - Lists are ordered, and the order of elements is preserved.

# 3. Allow Duplicates - Lists can have multiple items with the same value.
# 4. Indexing and Slicing - Elements can be accessed by index. Lists support slicing for accessing a range of elements.

# 5. Heterogeneous Elements - Lists can contain elements of different data types, including other lists.
# 6. Dynamic Size - Lists can grow or shrink in size (using append, insert, remove, etc.).

# 7. Nested Lists - Lists can contain other lists, useful for matrices or complex structures.
# 8. List Comprehensions - Provide a concise way to create lists with an expression inside brackets.

# 9. Iterability - Lists are iterable, allowing looping over each element.
# 10. Built-in Functions and Methods - Python provides functions like len(list) and methods like list.sort().
# 11. Variable Length Arguments - Lists can be used to pass variable-length arguments (*args) in functions.
