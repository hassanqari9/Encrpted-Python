# Data cleaning in Pandas

# Empty cells - if there are empty cells in the dataset, we can fill them with a value or drop them
# Wrong format - if the data is in the wrong format, we can convert it to a proper format. For example, a string '10' to a number 10
# Wrong data - if there is wrong data in the dataset, we can remove it. For example, a negative age, or if we know the values are between 0 and 120, everything above 120 can be removed
# Duplicates - we can remove duplicates
