'''
The program understands that 'x' represents the key, and 'y' represents the value because of the way result_dictionary.items()
The items() method of a dictionary returns a view of the dictionary's key-value pairs as tuples

In each iteration, the for loop unpacks the tuple into the variables x and y, so x is assigned the key, and y is assigned the value
