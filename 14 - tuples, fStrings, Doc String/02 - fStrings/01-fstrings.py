# fStrings are a new way to format strings in Python 3.6 and above.
# Literal for string interpolation (process of embedding or inserting values into a string)

# This is the old way of formatting strings

P1 = "ABC"

# fStrings are faster than the old way of formatting strings because they are evaluated at compile time rather than at run time.
