# Random distribution is a set of random numbers that follows a certain probability density function.
# Probability density function is a function that describes a continuous probability. i.e. probability of all values in an array.
# We can generate random numbers based on defined probabilities using the choice() method of the random module.

# Generate a random number from provided list
